# 🌌 Elementum: Galactic Scavenger

**A rogue-lite space mining adventure where every planet is unique and every jump could be your last.**  
Built in Python, *Elementum* challenges you to gather as many periodic elements as possible from AI-generated planets — all while managing a dwindling fuel supply in the cold void of space.

## 🧠 Project Vision

*Elementum* isn’t just a game. It’s a cosmic science scavenger hunt where machine learning and procedural generation shape entire star systems. The long-term goal is to simulate intelligent life, environments, and elemental distributions that evolve and adapt across galaxies — meaning no two playthroughs are ever the same.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

You're the commander of a lone exploration vessel, tasked with mining rare elements scattered across randomized planets. Fuel is scarce. Time is ticking. And you're lightyears from home.

### Objectives
- Travel from planet to planet within a procedurally generated star system.
- Scan planets for useful elements and land to mine them.
- Watch out for high hazard levels — they might cost you more than fuel.
- Manage your ship's inventory and avoid overloading.
- Return to base before you run out of fuel... or die trying.
