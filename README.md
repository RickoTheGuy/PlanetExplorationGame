# ðŸŒŒ Elementum: Galactic Scavenger

A terminal-based space exploration game where you mine AI-generated planets for periodic elements and try to survive the harshness of space with limited fuel.

## ðŸš€ Game Concept

You're a galactic explorer flying from planet to planet, scanning and mining alien worlds to collect as many elements from the periodic table as possible. Each planet is randomly generated with unique traits, hazards, and resources. But beware â€” every move costs fuel, and running out means game over.
